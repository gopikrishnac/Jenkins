The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:



1. Install Jenkins on the jenkins server using the apt utility only, and start it using the service command.

If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, first check the service status with service jenkins status
Then review the logs in /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log to identify the cause.
2. Jenkin's admin user name should be theadmin, password should be Adm!n321, full name should be Kirsty and email should be kirsty@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com.


Note:

1. To access the jenkins server, connect from the jump host using the root user with the password S3curePass.

2. After Jenkins server installation, click the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI and follow on-screen instructions to create an admin user.
